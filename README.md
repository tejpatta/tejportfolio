This webpage was created in response to boot camp assignment to apply skills learnt in CSS- particularly flexbox and grid, as well as media queries. It's an online portfolio to showcase the creators' work and enable prospective employers to contact them, as well as learn a bit more about them. Only the first two webpages featured in the section are clickable, the rest of the gallery is for propective projects which will be added as the user progresses in their learning journery. 

## Installation

Accesible on Git Hub Pages at the link below in 'usage'.

## Usage

To use this webpage, you can scroll along to read the content, or click the navigation links in the top right corner of the page to navigate to a specific section. Click on the 'Challenge' and 'Prework' boxes in the 'work' section to be taken to those deployed sites. The other tiles have a 'hover' effect but do not lead to other pages. 

## Credits

The source code for this project is taken from study materials from the bootcamp, and then edited to fulfill the learning objectives provided. I also used W3 Schools and the padding formula is taken from https://matthewjamestaylor.com/responsive-padding#magic-formula
